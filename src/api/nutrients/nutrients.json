This is becuase glucose, the simples form of carbohydrates, is the main energy fuel, not only for our cells, but for the majority of living organisms. Glucose can also be obtained from fats and protein, thus, carbohydrates are not essential for the human organism (the body can also obtain its energy requirements from ketones bodies). Carbohydrates are chains of sugar units. Based on these units, carbohydrates are classified as simple and complex. Carbohydrates are problematic, because their cause high amounts of blood glucose at once (blood glucose spike) which in term cause high amounts of insulin secretion to stabilise the glucose excess. This doesn't happen, though, with dietary fiber (complex carbohydrate), which actually slows down digestion and stabilises glucose levels, but only with simple carbohydrates (sugars). Fiber is the only essential type of carbohydrate. Also, sugars cause inflammation and lead to health problems.",

Fatty acids are classified as unsaturated fatty acids (fluid at low temperature and unstable) and saturated fatty acids (solid at low temperature and stable). Along with industrial food processing, unsaturated fatty acids have been hydrogenized (stabilised) to increase the shelf life in food stores, turning them into trans-unsaturated fats, which damage our health and leading to genetic mutations of our DNA and, thus, disease. Omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linoleic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)) and omega-6 fatty acids (linoleic acid) are the only essential fatty acids. Fatty acids are essential for cardiovascular system (blood vessels), cell membranes, nutrient absorption, endocrine system (hormone production), energy production and storage (metabolism), immune system, and nervous system (neurotransmitter production). Excess amounts of omega-6 fatty acids cause inflammation and lead to health problems. Be careful to keep a 2:1 intake ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, that is, for every gram of omega-3 fatty acids, you should not exceed 2 grams of omega-6 fatty acids.",

Sugars bring no benefits to our body, on the contrary, they damage our body. Sugars are rapidly absorbed and cause blood glucose spikes and high insulin secretion. Natural sugars from fruits and vegetables come along with fiber which slows down absorption. The real problem comes from refined sugars (sweeteners), which cause inflammation within our digestive system and cardiovascular system leading to health problems. They are found in all processed foods and desserts. Reduce sugars to less than 5% of daily energy intake."

They are found in all processed food and margarine. Trans fat cause inflammation. Long-term inflammation leads to chronic inflammation, that is, the immune system goes mad and triggers inflammation and immune reponses although there is no threat (it thinks it is something normal to do). This behaviour is an autoimmune problem caused by DNA damage and mutation. Chronic inflammation is the root cause of all diseases. Inflammation can be determined more precisely using a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Eliminate trans fat found in processed food completely for the sake of your health and wellness."
