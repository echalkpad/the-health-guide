    "summary": "Vitamin B12 or Cobalamin is an essential water-soluble nutrient, hence, it cannot be stored and is easily eliminated from the body through urine or perspiration. It is part of the vitamin B-complex family and works together with the rest of the B vitamins. It is the only vitamin that contains the essential mineral Cobalt. A deficiency of any of the B vitamins disrupts the function of the entire group. Vitamin B12 is essential for energy production (metabolism), red blood cell formation, and nervous system",
