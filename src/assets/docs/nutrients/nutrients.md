# Nutrients
Nutrients are organic compounds required by our body to function properly and evolve. The body is able to form some nutrients on its own, these are `Non-essential nutrients`, but the rest must be provided through nutrition, hence, they are `Essential nutrients`.

## Essential nutrients
- `Water`;
- `Oxygen`;
- `Fatty acids`: Omega-3 Fatty acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acid;
- `Amino acids`: Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan, and Valine;
- `Vitamins`: Choline, Vitamin A, Vitamin B-Complex, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Vitamin K;
- `Minerals`: Calcium, Chloride, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Phosphorus, Potassium, Selenium, Sodium, and Zinc.

All body processes require energy, which comes from three major nutrients that are required in greater amounts, hence, they are called `Macronutrients`.

> __Our body is a factory, nutrients are the machinery, and it requires fuel to work__.

### Macronutrients
- `Water`;
- `Oxygen`;
- `Carbohydrates`;
- `Fats (Fatty acids)`;
- `Protein (Amino acids)`;

As you may guess, the rest of the essential nutrients, Vitamins and Mineral, are required in lower amounts, hence, they are called `Micronutrients`.

### Micronutrients
- `Vitamins`;
- `Minerals`.

The summation of all body processes - `Chemical transformations` - that help our body function properly and evolve is called `Metabolism`.

Like everything in life, __Moderation is key to perfection__. Thus, although nutrients bring benefits to our body, they can also damage it if they are offered in large amounts. 
Our body is smart and has its own ways to maintain equilibrium, also known as `Homeostasis`. Yet, when the damage is too much at once or for too long time, the body fails to restore homeostasis. As a result, _Disease_ occurs and, in critical cases, _Death_.

> __The key to a healthy body (good metabolism) is to ensure provide all the essential nutrients.__

## Watch out's

> Nutrient absorption requires a healthy digestive tract, especially a healthy _Gut flora_, which is __damaged__ by:
- `Added sugars`;
- `Age`;
- `Alcohol`;
- `Caffeine`;
- `Pharmaceutical drugs`;
- `Sedentarism`;
- `Smoking`;
- `Stress`.

 > Nutrients should be provided from whole organic foods and not from supplements:
1. `Supplements are synthetic`: Our digestive system is not genetically designed to digest synthetic compounds. More, synthetic compounds destroy the `Gut flora` that is responsible for correct nutrient absorption. Thus, nutrients from supplements are not absorbed and are eliminated from the body.

2. `Nutrients are a team`: Supplements come with only one or two nutrients and it is not enough (This is why all doctors tell you to take them after meals). Nutrients help each other in their functions, hence, they are involved in all body processes. __If only one of the essential nutrients is missing, a chain reaction happens, and all body processes are interrupted. It's all or nothing__. If you try to provide all essential nutrients from supplements, you destroy your digestive system and put your health at risk.

3. `Supplements cause side effects`: As I said, our digestive system is not genetically designed to digest synthetic compounds, hence, their are seen as "intruders" in our body and may interfere with the metabolism.
