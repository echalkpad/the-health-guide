# Potassium (K)
Potassium (K) is an essential mineral element.

## Health support
- `Blood pH levels stabilisation`;
- `Blood sugar levels stabilisation`.
- `Blood vessel health`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Digestion`;
- `Growth`;
- `Hormone formation`;
- `Metabolism`;
- `Muscle health`;
- `Recovery`.

## Important relationships
- Magnesium - Blood pH levels stabilisation, Blood vessel health, Metabolism, Recovery.

## Daily requirements
- Men: 4700mg/day;
- Women: 4700mg/day;
- Pregnancy: 4700mg/day;
- Lactation: 5100mg/day.

## Food sources
- Herbs and spices;
- Peppers;
- Cacao;
- Beans;
- Seeds;
- Nuts;
- Bananas;
- Dried fruits.

## Deficiency signs
- Bloating;
- Breathing difficulties;
- Constipation;
- Gas;
- High blood pressure;
- Insomnia;
- Irregular heartbeats;
- Muscle problems (Cramps, Numbness, Tingling, Twitching, Weakness);
- Nausea;
- Vomiting.

## Watch out's
- 85% Potassium is absorbed.
- Destroyed by processing;
- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Caffeine;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
	- Sodium (Table salt);
    - Stress.

- Absorption `requires`:
	- Magnesium.

- Excess Potassium `impairs`:
	- Chloride absorption;
	- Sodium absorption.
