# Calcium (Ca)
Calcium (Ca) is an essential mineral element.

## Health support
- `Blood pH levels stabilisation`;
- `Bone health`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Growth`;
- `Muscle movements and strength`;
- `Pregnancy support`;
- `Teeth health`.

## Important relationships
- Magnesium, Phosphorus, Vitamin D - Bone health.

## Mechanism of action
> TO DO

## Daily requirements
- Men: 1200mg/day;
- Women: 1200mg/day;
- Pregnancy: 1300mg/day;
- Lactation: 1300mg/day.

## Food sources
- Herbs and spices;
- Cheese;
- Green vegetables.

## Deficiency signs
- Bone problems (Deformities, Fractures, Pain, Tenderness);
- Birth problems;
- Confusion;
- Dental problems;
- Growth impairment in children;
- Heart palpitations;
- Irregular heartbeats;
- Insomnia;
- Irritability;
- Muscle cramps;
- Muscle twitching;
- Nail brittleness;
- Numbness and tingling.

## Watch out's
- 50-70% Calcium is absorbed.

- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Caffeine;
    - Excess fat;
    - Excess Phosphorus
    - Excess protein;
    - Excess Sodium;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Non-organic milk;
    - Oxalic acid (Green vegetables);
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Phytic acid (Whole-grains);
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
    - Stress;
    - Zinc.

- Absorption `requires`:
    - Acid medium;
    - Fat;
    - Magnesium;
    - Protein;
    - Vitamin C;
    - Vitamin D.

- Excess Calcium `impairs`:
    - Iron absorption;
    - Magnesium absorption;
    - Phosphorus absorption;
    - Zinc absorption.
