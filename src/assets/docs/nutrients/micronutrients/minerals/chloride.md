# Chloride (Cl)
Chloride (Cl) or Chlorine is an essential mineral element.

## Health support
- `Blood pH levels stabilisation`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Digestion`;
- `Fluid levels stabilisation`;
- `Hormone formation`;
- `Mental functions`: Attention, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding;
- `Muscle health`.

## Important relationships
- Sodium - Mental functions, Muscle health, Blood pH and fluid levels stabilisation;
- Choline and Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) - Acetylcholine formation.

## Daily recommendations
- Men: 2300mg/day;
- Women: 2300mg/day;
- Pregnancy: 2300mg/day;
- Lactation: 2300mg/day.

## Food sources
- Table salt.

## Deficiency signs
- Appetite loss;
- Concentration difficulties;
- Digestion problems (Diarrhea, Nausea, Vomiting);
- Insomnia;
- Irritability;
- Memory problems;
- Muscle cramps;
- Potassium loss;
- Sleepiness;
- Sweating;
- Weakness;
- Weight loss.

## Watch out's
- 98% Chloride is absorbed.

- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Caffeine;
    - Gastrointestinal problems;
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Potassium;
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
    - Stress.

- Absorption `requires`;
    - Sodium.

- Excess Chloride causes:
    - Fluid retention;
    - Vitamin E absorption impairment.
