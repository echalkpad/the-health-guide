# Lipids
Lipids are macronutrients required for energy storage, cell membrane formation, and cell signaling (communication). They offer the greatest amounts of energy. Lipids are classified in three groups:

- `Triglycerides (Fatty acids or Fats)`: _Monounsaturated fatty acids_, _Polyunsaturated fatty acids_, _Saturated fatty acids_, and _Trans fatty acids_;
- `Phospholipids` - Cellular membrane formation (Cell protection);
- `Sterols (Cholesterol)` - Nutrient transportation, Hormone formation, and Neurotransmitter release (Cell signaling).

> __`Alpha-Linolenic acid (Omega-3 fatty acid)` and `Linoleic acid (Omega-6 fatty acid)`, two polyunsaturated fatty acids, are the only essential lipids__. All other lipids are produced by the body on its own, hence, are non-essential.

## Health support
- `Blood cholesterol levels stabilisation`;
- `Body temperature`;
- `Cellular membrane health (Cell protection)`;
- `Cellular signaling (Neurotransmitter release)`;
- `Growth`;
- `Energy production`;
- `Hormone formation`;
- `Mental functions`: Attention, Behaviour, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Social, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding;
- `Metabolism`;
- `Nutrient absorption and transportation`;
- `Positive attitude`;
- `Skin health`;
- `Senses`.

## Daily recommendations
- 30% daily energy intake.

## Food sources
- Vegetable oils;
- Butter;
- Margarine;
- Meat;
- Nuts;
- Seeds;
- Dairy.

## Deficiency signs
- Anxiety;

- Confusion;
- Depression;
- Fatigue;
- Growth impairment in children;
- Hair dryness;
- Hair loss;
- High blood pressure;
- Hunger;
- Indifference;
- Intellectual disability (Attention, Behaviour, Concentration, Decision making, Language, skills, Learning, Memory, Problem solving, Social, Speaking, Thinking, Understanding problems);
- Irritability;
- Mood swings;
- Motivation decrease;
- Nail brittleness;
- Nervousness;
- Skin problems (Acne, Itching, Inflammation, Lesions, Oiliness, Rash, Redness, Riddles, Wrinkles);
- Vision problems;
- Weight loss.

## Watch out's
- 95% of lipids in our body and food are tryglicerides;
- Unsaturated fats are the only type of fats that bring benefits to our body, hence, you cannot be deficient of saturated fats, nor trans fats;
- Reduce saturated fats as much as you can for optimal health (10% daily energy intake);
- Reduce trans fats completely for optimal health.

> __Saturated and Trans fats are BAD, Unsaturated fats are GOOD.__
