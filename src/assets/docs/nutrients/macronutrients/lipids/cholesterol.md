# Cholesterol
Cholesterol is a special type of lipid. It is a sterol (steroid alcohol) specific to animals and, thus, to humans, called `Zoosterol`. Sterols in plants are called `Phytosterols`.

## Functions and Health support
- `Bile acid formation`
    - Blood cholesterol elimination;
    - Fat digestion.
- `Cellular membrane health`
    - Cell protection;
    - Cell shape;
    - Cell signaling (Communication);
    - Intracellular transport.
- `Steroid hormone formation`
    - Behaviour and emotions;
    - Immunity;
    - Inflammation;
    - Carbohydrate, Lipid, and Protein metabolism;
    - Salt and water balance;
    - Sexual characteristics development (Sex hormones).
- `Vitamin D formation`
    - Fat-soluble vitamin metabolism (A, D, E, and K).

## How cholesterol works?
After digestion, lipids (triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, phospholipids, fatty acids, and cholesterol) need to be carried out of the small intestine throughout the body. The problem is lipids, due to their nature, are not soluble in water. Thus, they require some help to enter the bloodstream and travel to the cells. Fortunately, our body is smart and takes care of everything.

Lipids are organized and packaged in small molecules called `Lipoproteins`. As their name suggest, our lipids couple with proteins, which suround them in hydrophilic capsules (water lovers). You can imagine our lipids now traveling inside a shell of proteins that prevents liquid from entering.

Some lipoproteins carry a greater amount of lipids - are "fatter" - whereas other carry a smaller amount - are "thinner". The "thin" lipoproteins have higher density, because they are smaller and have more proteins than lipids, whereas the "fat" lipoproteins have lower density, because they are wider and have more lipids than proteins. Lipids require more space than proteins; that is why, for instance, body-builders are heavier than overweight people, although they have less body fat.

Based on their density, there are five types of lipoproteins:
- `Chylomicrons` or Ultra low-density lipoproteins (ULDL);
- `Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)`;
- `Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL)`;
- `Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)`;
- `High-density lipoprotein (HDL)`.

There are two ways cells can aquire their needed lipids: either from the small instine through dietary intake (externally), either made by the liver (internall), never from both.

Lipids from the small intestine travel as chylomicrons throughout the body (exogeneus pathway), whereas lipids from the liver travel as VLDL.

### Exogeneus pathway
Chylomicrons are the ones who carry triglycerides, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters from the small intestine to the cells. Now, this is where things get interesting. They cannot be used by the cells until they are provided an identity card and become mature. This is where HDL come into action. 

HDL are sent from the liver and travel along the bloodstream with two types of identity cards called `Apiloproteins`: one that allows them to be recognised and used by cells (`Apiloprotein C-II`) and one that allows their remnants to be recognised and recycled by the liver (`Apiloprotein E`).
Without these two apiloproteins (identity cards) chylomicrons just travel around the bloodstream and are never used, nor recycled.

After they have received their necesarry id's and further exhausted of their lipid contents by cells, they become chylomicron remnants (wastes) and continue to travel along the bloodstream untill they are taken up by the liver and recycled for future transportations.

### Endogeneus pathway
When cells require cholesterol, but there is not sufficient provided from dietary intake, the liver is the one who packages cholesterol, along with triglycerides and leftovers from previous processes (recycling), into lipoproteins, this time called VLDL. Similarly with chylomicrons, VLDL's cannot be used until they acquire their identity cards from HDL's and become mature.

As they loose their lipid contents, they decrease their size and become thinner (more dense). Thus, they incrementally change state to IDL's and, further, to LDL's. In other words, VLDL remnants are IDL's and IDL remnants are LDL's. Each remnant could be taken up by the liver and recycled, via apiloprotein E, or can continue their journey and be used by cells, untill their "sucked up" of all their fat content, via apiloprotein C-II.

### High blood cholesterol
In a perfect world, the process continues forever uninterrupted. However, we do no live in a perfect world. There are many people who hvae high blood cholesterol and we have become to think cholesterol is food is the problem. As we have seen, that is not the case, because the liver stabilises blood cholesterol.

__High blood cholesterol is not a problem of cholesterol itself, but rather a problem of cholesterol transportation process.__

High blood cholesterol occurs when there are two many LDL's (chylomicrons, VLDL's, IDL's, or/and LDL's) in the blood. There are __two explanations__ for this:
1. `There are few HDL's in the blood`;
2. `HDL's give broken apiloproteins (identity cards)`.

This is why HDL is called "good" cholesterol, whereas LDL is called "bad" cholesterol. 

LDL's that are never used (_foreign_), nor recycled, are eaten by `Macrophages` (white blood cells). Furthermore, macrophages become fat, engorged and become foam cells ("couch potatoes"). These foam cells no longer move and become trapped on blood vessels, similar to grease in the sink. These faom deposits block blood flow, create tension on blood vessels, and exhaust the heart.

Thus, high blood cholesterol is an internal liver problem. __Either the HDL production is interrupted, either HDL's are produced wrong with broken apiloproteins (DNA mutations)__.

## Watch out's
- Absorption is `impaired` by:
    - Phytosterols;
- High blood cholesterol `possible factors`:
    - Added sugars;
    - Age;
    - Alcohol;
    - Pharmaceutical drugs;
    - Saturated fat;
    - Sedentarism;
    - Smoking;
    - Stress;
    - Trans fat.
